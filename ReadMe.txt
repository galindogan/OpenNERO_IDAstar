This version of  OpenNERO was expanded by changing the maze object from the default settings to a 14x14 maze.  Addtionally, metrics were added to measure the elapsed time in seconds and in peak thread usage through the installation of 2 python utilities.  Additionally, the team incorporated an interative deepending A* search into the agent object to compare the various variants of the A* algorithm[1].
